Continiuing from our [previous example](https://rkube.github.io/julia/zygote/2022/02/16/backprop-sim.html)
we continue looking at calculating the gradient of phyics-motivated calculations,
motivated by doing gradient based optimization. And as before, we consider
a profile, for example density, with a peak whose amplitude is parameterized
by the parameter $$t$$

$$\begin{align}
n(z) = n_0 + \sin(t)^2 \left( \frac{\left(x-x_0\right)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
\end{align}$$
